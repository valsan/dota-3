# dota-3
Whitebox project to try implementation of typical MOBA/RTS mechanics. 
### Update 9/7/2023
In particular, as I aquired knowledge on developing a simple 4 players networked game (P2P) on different project, and after seeing that DOTS/ECS and Netcode for Entities
have been release I'm gonna try and use that stack to implement a more robust architechture.


## Currently implemented mechanics
* Character movement
* Auto attack
* AoE damage spell
* Simple enemy AI which targets tower or main character when approached

## Next steps (where it gets hard)
* Add multiplayer character movement, server hosted
* Team based Fog of war
